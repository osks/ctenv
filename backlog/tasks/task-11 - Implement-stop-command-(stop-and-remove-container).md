## Description

Implement the 'stop' command that stops and removes the named container.

Key features:
- Find the container using the same naming logic as other commands
- Gracefully stop the container (docker stop) with timeout
- Remove the container after stopping (docker rm)
- Handle cases where container doesn't exist gracefully
- Provide clear feedback about what was stopped/removed
- Support --force flag for immediate termination if needed
- Clean up any associated resources

This command completes the container lifecycle management, allowing users to cleanly shut down persistent containers created with 'start' command.
