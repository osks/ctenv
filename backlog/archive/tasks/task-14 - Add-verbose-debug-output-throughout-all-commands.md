## Description

Add comprehensive verbose and debug output support across all ctenv commands.

Key features:
- Add global --verbose/-v flag to main CLI group
- Add detailed debug output showing:
  - Configuration values being used
  - Container runtime commands being executed
  - Container creation/connection steps
  - Volume mount details
  - Environment variable handling
  - Network configuration
- Use consistent logging format with timestamps
- Implement different verbosity levels if needed
- Ensure debug output helps troubleshoot common issues
- Add --quiet flag to suppress non-essential output
- Include debug output in test scenarios

This improves troubleshooting capabilities and helps users understand what ctenv is doing, especially when things go wrong.
